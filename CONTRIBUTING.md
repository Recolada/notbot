# Contributing to the bot

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the bot. I greatly welcome and appreciate all support, whether financial, moral, spiritual, or otherwise.

## How can I contribute?

You can contribute in any number of ways you like:
* Filing issues / bug reports
* Contributing code fixes and new features
* Adding to the bot's patreon account or github sponsors when I enable it
* Sending hugs and/or coffee
* Suggesting new features

I don't really mind what you choose to do or how you choose to do it, I just ask that you follow the code of conduct and be a responsible adult (or teen if you identify as one of those).

## Can I fork your code and/or run my own instance?

Of course, I just ask that you link back to this repository so that others can contribute to the source.
